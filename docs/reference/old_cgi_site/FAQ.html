	<a name="Q1"></a><li><b>What is the difference between AFG and AFGGAB?</b><p>

		The AFG group hosts two email lists, the official <i>moderated</i> AFG list (hf-afg@googlegroups.com) and the unofficial <i>unmoderated</i> social gab list AFGGAB (hf-afggab@googlegroups.com).

<hr><p>

	<a name="Q2"><li><b>Who can sign up?</b><p>

AFG and AFGGAB are open to the Holy Family Parish Alleluia Folk Group
music ministry and interested Holy Family parishioners and ministers.
<hr><p>

	<a name="Q3"><li><b>Why is the official AFG list moderated?</b><p>

This is to keep the AFG list (hf-afg@googlegroups.com) as focused as possible on
critical time-sensitive messages that affect the coordination of the
Alleluia Folk Group ministry at Holy Family Parish.<p>

What this means on a practical level is that all postings to this address
are reviewed by me and sent through if they meet the following single
criteria:<p>

<ul>
 <li><u>The message must be an official announcements of vital interest to the
  whole group (schedules, web updates, last minute music menu changes,
  Diocesan workshops, etc).</u><p>
</ul>

If the email sent to AFG does NOT meet this criteria, it will NOT be sent
to AFG and instead routed to AFGGAB.
<hr><p>


	<a name="Q4"><li><b>Why is AFGGAB unmoderated?</b><p>

The AFGGAB mailing list, on the other hand, is for chat, jokes, political
discussions, birth announcements, invitations to Open Houses, personal
notes, prayer requests, eggnog recipes, etc. Anything goes (but keep it
"PG-13" as a general rule of thumb).
<hr><p>


<a name="Q5"><li><b>Which list/s should I be subscribed to?</b><p>

If you need notices of official AFG information and nothing else, subscribe
to AFG. All members of AFG should be on this list.

If you also enjoy the gab, you should belong to BOTH lists: AFG and
AFGGAB. That way you get the official announcements and critical news and
you can participate with the gab as well.

<hr><p>
<a name="Q6"><li><b>How much volume does AFG (hf-afg@googlegroups.com) have on a normal week?</b><p>

Sometimes nothing for a week or two at a time! Even high volume weeks on
AFG should only be maybe 5 emails or so (a newsletter, a menu update, a
sudden change in Sunday Mass set-up, etc).

<hr><p>
<a name="Q7"><li><b>How much volume does AFGGAB (afggab@sylvan.com) have on a normal week?</b><p>

AFGGAB is at times a high volume list with anywhere from 12 - 48 emails
per week depending on the topics and humors of the list. Sometimes
discussions will get involved (such as when discussing Catholic
doctrine) and this is just the nature of the list where volume can not be
predicted week to week.

<hr><p>
<a name="Q8"><li><b>What if I like to hear prayer requests (or birth announcements, or
Open House announcements, etc) but don't want to be on a high volume list
like AFGGAB?</b><p>

The weekly newsletter should contain all of this information and is sent
in a single email to the moderated AFG (hf-afg@googlegroups.com) each week. You
will still get the news, but a few days later in a consolidated form that
fits the moderated nature of AFG.

<hr><p>
<a name="Q9"><li><b>How can I unsubscribe from AFGGAB? (or AFG)</b><p>

To unsubscribe from HF-AFG or HF-AFGGAB, use the normal Google Groups interface,
or Send an Email to Joan or Kayvan.

<hr><p>
<a name="Q10"><li><b>How can I subscribe to AFGGAB (or AFG)</b><p>

To subscribe to AFG or AFGGAB, use Google Groups and request membership.
